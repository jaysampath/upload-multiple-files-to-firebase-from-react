<h1> Upload Multiple files to Firebase from React </h1>

<p>
     In many use cases we come across a situation where we need to handle files from frontend. For example an online job application app has a form where we will be uploading different kinds of files like resume, certificates, pictures etc. It is a known fact that large application don't send the file in byte format to backend. Then we need to come up with a solution like we store files in some storage service where it will revert back you the uploaded file url, so that we can send the url to backend to store for futher usage. This project is the solution to that scenario where it uses firebase from react. It supports all file format.
